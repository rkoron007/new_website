#### Local setup

After successfully installing those dependencies, open this theme with any IDE [[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended], and then open the internal terminal of IDM [vs code shortcut <code>ctrl/cmd+\`</code>]

* Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

* Run locally

```
npm run dev
```

After that, it will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to source files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved.

#### Production Build

After finishing all the customization, you can create a production build by running this command.

```
npm run build
```

Now you get a `theme` folder that has all the changes you have made. you can use this folder as your main theme.
